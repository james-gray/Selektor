# Selektor

In the middle of a DJ set and at a loss for what track to play next? Selektor can help.

Selektor will carefully analyze your music collection, and if you tell it what track you're currently playing, will suggest a track for you to mix into. Basing its recommendation on feature such as track BPM, timbre, key, and loudness, the app is a great tool for aspiring or beginner DJs to get to know their track collection and to hone their track selection skills!
